Now we have news that <a href=\"https://sonyinteractive.com/en/news/blog/difficult-news-about-our-workforce/?sf271923331=1\">Sony is laying off 900 people</a> across its studios all over the world. Why is the maker of the hugely successful PlayStation 5, which has outsold its main rival by three to one, doing something so drastic? It seems that the end of the console wars might come not by choice, but by necessity: the way that the games industry worked in the past is simply not how it works now.</p><p>The news that PlayStation would be laying off what amounts 8% of its workforce came via an all-company email from Jim Ryan, the company\u2019s outgoing boss \u2013 who, less than a week ago, <a href=\"https://x.com/nathan_brown/status/1762466931070619950?s=20\">was pictured</a> celebrating his Sony career at London Studios with many people who now no longer have jobs: the company is closing it entirely, along with cuts at Firesprite, and there will be \u201creductions in various functions\u201d across the company in the UK. Guerilla Games (makers of the Horizon series), Naughty Dog (The Last of Us) and Insomniac (Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man) are also seeing reductions. At the time of writing, Sony employees at US studios were still waiting to hear how they would be affected. \u201cPlease be kind to yourselves and to each other,\u201d the email ends, with almost jaw-dropping irony.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2024/feb/28/pushing-buttons-playstation-job-losses\">Continue reading...</a>",

Created by the Canada-based developer Digital Extremes, Warframe is an online sci-fi shooter, originally launched in 2013. Though little discussed outside its fanbase, it is consistently one of the biggest titles on Steam, with 75 million registered users.</p><p>Set in a distant future version of our solar system, riddled with warring alien factions, the player takes part on the side of the Tenno, an ancient warrior race that employs barely sentient cybernetic fighters \u2013 the warframes of the title \u2013 as their primary weapons. Each day, Zac spends hours whizzing between planets, carrying out missions or exploring, all the while fighting enemies including a brutish clone army known as the Grineer, and the diseased, monstrous Infested. It sounds like a dozen other so-called live service games, which run indefinitely online, constantly adding new tasks, locations and items \u2013 the likes of Destiny, The Division and Final Fantasy XIV Online. But Warframe has held my son\u2019s attention, and there\u2019s one key reason for that: a remarkably friendly and welcoming community.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2024/feb/28/in-a-toxic-online-world-warframe-is-a-refuge-for-my-son-and-millions-of-others\">Continue reading...</a>",

        "description": "<p>Last week, I downloaded a game called Balatro for a few casual turns on Steam Deck. I haven\u2019t been able to think of much else since</p><p>I am one of those people who feels like crying when the rules of a board game are explained to me, so card games are generally not my thing. In real life poker, I inevitably get bored after a few rounds, go all in, and crash out spectacularly, just so something will happen. But real life poker is not Balatro. Balatro might be the best card game you will ever come across. I specifically left my Steam Deck at home this morning so that I would not sit at my desk playing Balatro instead of doing all the other, less fun things I am supposed to do at work, such as staring disconsolately at my perpetually overflowing email inbox. I think it will be one of the breakout games of the year. Join me, and it will suck you in, too.</p><p>Here is how you play. You\u2019re dealt a hand of nine normal playing cards, and then you play the best four or five-card poker hand you can muster from them: flush, straight, three of a kind, all that. Then you\u2019re scored on the hand, with satisfying, ratcheting \u201cding!\u201ds, and you move on to the next one. You\u2019re only ever playing against yourself: beat the points target, which at the beginning is maybe a few hundred easily scored points, and you move on to the next round.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2024/feb/27/balatro-mashup-solitaire-poker-has-taken-over-my-life-roguelike\">Continue reading...</a>",

I know it\u2019s a terrible thing to do; I know it serves no purpose other than to get me to do more of it, taking my money in ever larger fistfuls as I plunge deeper and deeper into the mire of addiction. But there I was. I was back on the Fifa. (Or rather, the EA Sports FC 24, as they lost the official rights.)</p><p>It was a 10-hour free trial on Xbox Live. Ten hours, that\u2019ll be OK, I told myself. Just a taste. See what it\u2019s like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2021/oct/08/the-beautiful-game-got-ugly-why-i-broke-up-with-fifa-dominik-diamond-gamesmaster\">after 30 months away</a>.
