It\u2019s the gaming equivalent of honey and lemon and a hot-water bottle, full of goodness and warmth. But it\u2019s also strange and melancholic, that signature mark of the Moomins, and part of the reason for the enduring popularity of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/jun/05/tove-jansson-moomins-woman-fell-in-love-with-an-island-summer-book\">Tove Jansson</a>\u2019s creations. It\u2019s weird, sad, eerie, wholesome and delightful.</p><p>The plot sees the philosophical wanderer Snufkin making his way back to Moominvalley in the spring, ready to meet his best friend, Moomintroll, after the Moomins have woken from their winter hibernation. But he finds his way is blocked by a park patrolled by policemen. The Hemulen park keeper has decided to extend his remit, building gardens across Moominvalley that are governed by strict rules nailed to signposts. Incensed at this unwarranted enclosure of nature, Snufkin begins tearing up the signs; and in a charming piece of logic, the policemen simply wander off once all the signposts are gone, since they no longer have any rules to enforce. This leaves Snufkin free to rewild the area, ripping up paving slabs and dismantling fences.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2024/mar/06/snufkin-melody-of-moominvalley-review-a-fleeting-tour-of-tove-janssons-beguiling-world\">Continue reading...</a>",

She had lost her job at a furniture company and moved back home with her mother. Her nine-year relationship had always been turbulent; lately, the fights had been escalating and she was thinking of leaving. She didn\u2019t feel she could be fully honest with the therapist she saw once a week, but she didn\u2019t like lying, either. Nor did she want to burden her friends: she struggles with social anxiety and is cautious about oversharing.</p><p>So one night in October she logged on to <a href=\"https://beta.character.ai/\">character.ai</a> \u2013 a neural language model that can impersonate anyone from Socrates to Beyonc\u00e9 to Harry Potter \u2013 and, with a few clicks, built herself a personal \u201cpsychologist\u201d character. From a list of possible attributes, she made her bot \u201ccaring\u201d, \u201csupportive\u201d and \u201cintelligent\u201d. \u201cJust what you would want the ideal person to be,\u201d Christa tells me. She named her Christa 2077: she imagined it as a future, happier version of herself.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/mar/02/can-ai-chatbot-therapists-do-better-than-the-real-thing\">Continue reading...</a>",

        "description": "<p><strong>Blaze Entertainment; Evercade consoles<br /></strong>Paradroid, Boulder Dash and Break Dance are among the classic C64 games repackaged for the 21st century in this weird but lovely compilation</p><p>It is an odd feeling having an unremitting barrage of childhood memories fired at you by a game cartridge no larger than a matchbox. That\u2019s certainly been my experience of the C64 Collection 3, the latest in a series of vintage gaming compilations assembled by Blaze Entertainment for its Evercade retro consoles. Each of these little carts contains a dozen or so classic titles from various arcade manufacturers and home computers, all emulated to a pretty high standard. This one, for me, and I suspect a lot of other C64 veterans, is unmissable \u2013 for several reasons.</p><p>One is that it contains what I think is one of the greatest home computer games ever made: Paradroid. It\u2019s a top-down multidirectional sci-fi blaster by Hewson, beautifully styled, fiendishly difficult and with one of the earliest examples of the now ubiquitous hacking mini-game.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2024/feb/29/c64-collection-3-review-blaze-entertainment-evercade-console\">Continue reading...</a>",

Sign up here</a></strong></p><p>I wrote last week about the decades-long console wars between Xbox and PlayStation \u2013 and how the Microsoft\u2019s looser attitude to releasing games everywhere people play them, even on rival consoles, might be the beginning of an end to them. Now we have news that <a href=\"https://sonyinteractive.com/en/news/blog/difficult-news-about-our-workforce/?sf271923331=1\">Sony is laying off 900 people</a> across its studios all over the world. Why is the maker of the hugely successful PlayStation 5, which has outsold its main rival by three to one, doing something so drastic? It seems that the end of the console wars might come not by choice, but by necessity: the way that the games industry worked in the past is simply not how it works now.</p><p>The news that PlayStation would be laying off what amounts 8% of its workforce came via an all-company email from Jim Ryan, the company\u2019s outgoing boss \u2013 who, less than a week ago, <a href=\"https://x.com/nathan_brown/status/1762466931070619950?s=20\">was pictured</a> celebrating his Sony career at London Studios with many people who now no longer have jobs: the company is closing it entirely, along with cuts at Firesprite, and there will be \u201creductions in various functions\u201d across the company in the UK. Guerilla Games (makers of the Horizon series), Naughty Dog (The Last of Us) and Insomniac (Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man) are also seeing reductions. At the time of writing, Sony employees at US studios were still waiting to hear how they would be affected. \u201cPlease be kind to yourselves and to each other,\u201d the email ends, with almost jaw-dropping irony.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2024/feb/28/pushing-buttons-playstation-job-losses\">Continue reading...</a>",

Though little discussed outside its fanbase, it is consistently one of the biggest titles on Steam, with 75 million registered users.</p><p>Set in a distant future version of our solar system, riddled with warring alien factions, the player takes part on the side of the Tenno, an ancient warrior race that employs barely sentient cybernetic fighters \u2013 the warframes of the title \u2013 as their primary weapons. Each day, Zac spends hours whizzing between planets, carrying out missions or exploring, all the while fighting enemies including a brutish clone army known as the Grineer, and the diseased, monstrous Infested. It sounds like a dozen other so-called live service games, which run indefinitely online, constantly adding new tasks, locations and items \u2013 the likes of Destiny, The Division and Final Fantasy XIV Online. But Warframe has held my son\u2019s attention, and there\u2019s one key reason for that: a remarkably friendly and welcoming community.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2024/feb/28/in-a-toxic-online-world-warframe-is-a-refuge-for-my-son-and-millions-of-others\">Continue reading...</a>",
